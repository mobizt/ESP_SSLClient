The upgradable SSL Client for ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and other Arduino devices (except for avr) that supports external networking interfaces e.g., WiFiClient, EthernetClient, and GSMClient.

This library provided the Secure Layer Networking (SSL/TLS) TCP Client.

The Arduino Client library buffer size should be large enough (1k or more) for transporting SSL data.

The RP2040 boards required Arduino-Pico SDK from Earle F. Philhower https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico

This library used light weight SSL engine library BearSSL for secure data encryption and decryption.

In ESP8266 device, the native BearSSL in Core SDK will be used and built-in BearSSL library will be used for other Arduino devices.

This library is fully compatible and able to work with [ESP-Mail-Client](https://github.com/mobizt/ESP-Mail-Client) library seamlessly.


### Supposted Arduino Devices with flash size > 128k.

 * ESP32
 * ESP8266
 * Arduino SAMD
 * Arduino STM32
 * Teensy 3.1 to 4.1
 * Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect
 * Raspberry Pi Pico
 * Arduino UNO R4 WiFi (Renesas).
 
 ### Supposted Networking Devices with Client (with driver) library.

 * WIZnet Wxxx series modules
 * All SPI Ethernet modules
 * All GSM modules
 * All WiFi modules


Some PHY and MAC ethernet chips are already supported by Core `WiFiClientSecure` and ethernet libraries which this `ESP_SSLClient` library is not needed.

The following PHY ethernet chips i.e. LAN8720, TLK101, RTL8201, DP83848, DM9051, KSZ8041 and KSZ8081 were supported by ESP32 Arduino Core natively then this and can be used with `WiFiClientSecure.h` and `ETH.h` libraries as normally.


The SPI Ethernet module that uses WIZNet W5100, W5500 and ENC28J60 are supported by ESP8266 Arduino Core natively and can be used with `WiFiClientSecure.h` and `ENC28J60lwIP.h` or `W5100lwIP.h` or `W5500lwIP.h` libraries as normally.

 
## Features

* **Uses BearSSL SSL engine for all devices (since v2.0.0).**

* **Supports all Arduino devices with enough program flash space (128k or more).**

* **First and only one SSL Client library that supports SSL/TLS connection upgrades.**

* **Support STARTTLS in Email application.**

* **Use Client pointer without copy to constructor then it can be changed seemlessly at run time.**

* **The receive and transmit buffer memory can be reserved as supported by BearSSL.**

* **Easy to use as it provides the same interface functions as in ESP8266's WiFiClientSecure.**

* **Supports the authentications as in WiFiClientSecure.**



## Basic Usage
```cpp
  #include <Arduino.h>
  #if defined(ESP32) || defined(ARDUINO_RASPBERRY_PI_PICO_W)
  #include <WiFi.h>
  #elif defined(ESP8266)
  #include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
  #elif __has_include(<WiFiNINA.h>)
  #include <WiFiNINA.h>
  #elif __has_include(<WiFi101.h>)
  #include <WiFi101.h>
  #elif __has_include(<WiFiS3.h>)
  #include <WiFiS3.h>
  #endif

  #define ENABLE_DEBUG // To enable debugging
  #define ENABLE_ERROR_STRING // To show details in error
  #define DEBUG_PORT Serial // To define the serial port for debug printing

  // If board supports the filesystem APIs, to use CertStore class.
  // #define ENABLE_FS
  
  #include <ESP_SSLClient.h>

  ESP_SSLClient ssl_client;
  EthernetClient basic_client;
  
  // ignore server ssl certificate verification
  ssl_client.setInsecure();

  /** Call setDebugLevel(level) to set the debug
  * esp_ssl_debug_none = 0
  * esp_ssl_debug_error = 1
  * esp_ssl_debug_warn = 2
  * esp_ssl_debug_info = 3
  * esp_ssl_debug_dump = 4
  */
  ssl_client.setDebugLevel(1);

  // Set the receive and transmit buffers size in bytes for memory allocation (512 to 16384).
  // For server that does not support SSL fragment size negotiation, leave this setting the default value
  // by not set any buffer size or set the rx buffer size to maximum SSL record size (16384) and 512 for tx buffer size.  
  ssl_client.setBufferSizes(1024 /* rx */, 512 /* tx */);
  
  // Assign the basic client
  // Due to the basic_client pointer is assigned, to avoid dangling pointer, basic_client should be existed 
  // as long as it was used by ssl_client for transportation.
  ssl_client.setClient(&basic_client);

  Serial.print("Connecting to server...");

  String payload = "{\"title\":\"hello\"}";

  if (ssl_client.connect("reqres.in", 443))
  {
    Serial.println(" ok");
    Serial.println("Send POST request...");
    ssl_client.print("POST /api/users HTTP/1.1\r\n");
    ssl_client.print("Host: reqres.in\r\n");
    ssl_client.print("Content-Type: application/json\r\n");
    ssl_client.print("x-api-key: reqres-free-v1\r\n");
    ssl_client.print("Content-Length: ");
    ssl_client.print(payload.length());
    ssl_client.print("\r\n\r\n");
    ssl_client.print(payload);

    Serial.print("Read response...");

    unsigned long ms = millis();
    while (!ssl_client.available() && millis() - ms < 3000)
    {
      delay(0);
    }
    
    Serial.println();
    while (ssl_client.available())
    {
      Serial.print((char)ssl_client.read());
    }
    Serial.println();
  }
  else
    Serial.println(" failed\n");

  ssl_client.stop();

```

## RP2040 Arduino SDK installation

For Arduino IDE, the Arduino-Pico SDK can be installed from Boards Manager by searching pico and choose Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 to install.

For PlatformIO, the Arduino-Pico SDK can be installed via platformio.ini

```ini
[env:rpipicow]
platform = https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi.git
board = rpipicow
framework = arduino
board_build.core = earlephilhower
monitor_speed = 115200
```

See this Arduino-Pico SDK [documentation](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.



## Functions Interfaces

The ESP_SSLClient available functions are similare to the WiFiClientSecure.h class in ESP8266.

The Sessions and ServerSessions for ESP8266 BearSSL will be renamed to BearSSL_Sessions and BearSSL_ServerSessions respectively.

For all functions available in this library, see [src/client/BSSL_TCP_Client.h](/src/client/BSSL_TCP_Client.h)


## Additional Functions

The following are the additional functions over ESP8266 WiFiClientSecure.

### Set the client.

param **`client`** The pointer to Client interface.

param **`enableSSL`** The ssl option; true for enable, false for disable.

Due to the client pointer is assigned, to avoid dangling pointer, client should be existed as long as it was used for transportation.

```cpp
void setClient(Client *client, bool enableSSL = true);
```


### Set debug level.

param **`level`** The debug level or esp_ssl_client_debug_level.

esp_ssl_debug_none = 0

esp_ssl_debug_error = 1

esp_ssl_debug_warn = 2

esp_ssl_debug_info = 3

esp_ssl_debug_dump = 4

```cpp
void setDebugLevel(int level);
```


### Validate the last Client connection with these host and port.

param **`host`** The server host name.

param **`port`** The server port to connect.

The Client connection will be closed when the provided host or port is not match with that of last connection.

```cpp
void validate(const char *host, uint16_t port);
```


### Validate the last Client connection with these IP and port.

param **`ip`** The server IP to connect.

param **`port`** The server port to connect.

The Client connection will be closed when the provided IP or port is not match with that of last connection.

```cpp
void validate(IPAddress ip, uint16_t port);
```


### Enable/disable the SSL layer transport.

param **`enable`** The enable option; true for enable, false to disable.

```cpp
void enableSSL(bool enable);
```


### Upgrade the current connection by setting up the SSL and perform the SSL handshake.

return **`operating result`**.

```cpp
bool connectSSL();
```

### Set the TCP connection timeout in seconds.

param **`seconds`** The TCP connection timeout in seconds.

```cpp
int setTimeout(uint32_t seconds);
```

### Get the TCP connection timeout in seconds.

return **`The TCP connection timeout`** in seconds.

```cpp
int getTimeout();
```

### Set the SSL handshake timeout in seconds.

param **`handshake_timeout`** The SSL handshake timeout in seconds.

```cpp
void setHandshakeTimeout(unsigned long handshake_timeout);
```

### Set the TCP session timeout in seconds.

param **`seconds`** The TCP session timeout in seconds.

The minimum session timeout value is 60 seconds.

Set 0 to disable session timed out.

If There is no data to send (write) within this period, the current connection will be closed and reconnect.

This requires when ESP32 WiFiClient was used.

```cpp
int setSessionTimeout(uint32_t seconds);
```
